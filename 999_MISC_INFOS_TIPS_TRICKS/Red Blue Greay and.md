## ==Red Team and Blue Team==

If you think red or blue you will lose.

> When it comes to cyber security planning, it's important to remember that we don't live in a movie where the Jedi always save the galaxy. In the real world, no matter how great your security operations center (SOC) is or how talented your red team actors is, they will never be leading actors in a galaxay far far away.  There is only one yoda, only one vadar.  We can try to emulate, but fully know their full potential. The context behind cyber attacks is not black and white, but rather gray (or purple), with too many undefined variables and unknown conditions. Knowing nobody will ever obtain perfection, everyone will eventually fall short, and that some level of "failure"  removes the black and white thinking.  ( Picture me airquoting, because I believe failure only exists when you quit, you never truely fail if you don't quit, as I tell my son, you will always achieve, goals need to be malleable enough so that you never fail, you either learn or win.)

> Anyways, back to the real portion, Red and Blue, black and white is only exists in a galaxy far away.  If you think, act, and  realize gray is the only way, than you promote a culture where fear is removed, and failure is not critical, but part of the process.This means recognizing that there will always be some level of risk and uncertainty, and working to mitigate that risk through a combination of proactive defense and reactive response.To be successful in cyber security, it's important to have a great organization with strong supporting processes and talented individuals, just like the Rebel Alliance in Star Wars. But even the best organization can't prevent every attack, just like the Jedi can't always defeat every enemy. It's important to have a realistic understanding of what is possible, and to plan accordingly.

> So, rather than striving for perfection, focus on being resilient and adaptable. This means having a comprehensive incident response plan in place, and continually testing and improving your defenses through red team exercises and other forms of testing. It also means having a culture of continuous improvement, where you are always looking for ways to improve your security posture and reduce risk. The key to successful cyber security is to think, without trying to enumerate a number, in shades of gray (or purple), and to be prepared for the unexpected. Don't let the fear of unknown risks paralyze you, but rather use it as a motivator to continually improve your defenses and be better prepared for whatever comes your way.
