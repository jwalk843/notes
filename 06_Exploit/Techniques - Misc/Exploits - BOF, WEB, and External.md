## BOF

A typical buffer overflow attack scenario involves overwriting the return address with a JMP ESP instruction, which instructs the program to jump to the stack and execute the shellcode that has been injected right after the beginning of the payload. The shellcode is usually generated using msfvenom, and is a reverse shell that connects back to the attacker's machine.

### Finding the offset

The first step is to find the offset at which the return address is overwritten. This can be done using the pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb scripts from Metasploit.

This kind of attack has been documented since the late 1980s, prompting the development of various mitigations like ASLR and Executable Space Protection,4 among others. Since exploit mitigations are not in scope for this Module, we'll assume our target has none enabled.

The general flow of a standard stack-based buffer overflow is fairly straightforward. The exploit will:

1. Create a large buffer to trigger the overflow.
1. Take control of EIP by overwriting a return address on the stack, padding the large buffer with an appropriate offset.
1. Include a chosen payload in the buffer prepended by an optional NOP5 sled.
1. Choose a correct return address instruction such as JMP ESP (or a different register) to redirect the execution flow to the payload.
